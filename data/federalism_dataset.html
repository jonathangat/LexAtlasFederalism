      <td>Restrictions were ended by the Federal Government / the Federal Minister of Health as he is competent to
        decree nation-wide measures. This means that it was also he who decided on the loosening of these measures.
        After stricter measures in the winter of 2021/2022, it was he who started a continuous loosening of measures
        which more or less came to an end at the end of February 2023 (mask requirement dropped for healthcare
        settings). However, between June 2021 and February 2023, the Governor of Vienna steadily decreed stricter
        measures at State level (he was entitled to do this in his role as a federal health authority by the Infectious
        Diseases Act). During the "loosening" starting in spring 2022, all governors with the exception of the Governor
        of Vienna refrained from decreeing stricter/additional measures. Only the Governor of Vienna stuck to stricter
        measures, in particular test/vaccination requirements in spring 2022, an obligation to wear masks in public
        transport until spring 2023 and stricter rules for health care settings.</td>
      <td>On 11 March 2022, the Federal Government enacted a statute declaring the end of the epidemic emergency,
        thereby repealing most of the applicable health measures. The health measures adopted by the Federal Government
        were applicable throughout all Belgium and could not be derogated from by the SNGs. SNGs were only allowed to
        complement them with stricter measures. After 11 March 2022, only limited restrictions remained applicable (such
        as wearing a mask in public transportation), notably based on SNG’ regulations.</td>
      <td>Pandemic measures were made legally possible only on a temporary basis, i.e. so long as law 13.979/2020
        remained in force. The sunset provision was that law 13979 (art. 8) would remain in force so long as the
        declaration of a state of calamity by Legislative Decree 6/2020 also remained in force. With the expiration of
        LD 6/2020 on 31.12.2020, political party Rede went to the Supreme Court and the judges themselves extended the
        validity of art. 3 of the law 13.979, which enables public health measures and decoupled it from the sunset
        clause (ADI 6625). As this case is still pending at the Supreme Court, art. 3 is still in force to date. In
        practice, however, pandemic measures were discontinued and brought back by state governors and mayors throughout
        the pandemic based on art. 3 of Law 13979 and the “end of the pandemic” was finally declared by Ordinance 913,
        of 22.4.2022, yet by then most measures had already been discontinued by governors and mayors. (se PORTARIA

      <td>It depends on what you mean by ‘pandemic measures’. Some of the pandemic recovery measures adopted by the EU
        (the ‘Rescue and Resilience Facility’) are still very much in force and will continue to be so for the
        foreseeable future. Restrictions in the sense of stay-at-home orders and closures of businesses are a matter for
        the Member States, not the EU. Restrictions on travel are a shared EU/Member State competence.</td>
      <td>The end of pandemic measures was an important topic when the new federal government was formed in autumn 2021.
        Especially because of the influence of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the coalition partys (at that time
        bargaining the coalition agreement for the new Federal Government) announced that all severe measures should
        come to an end by 20 March 2022. The 'epidemic emergency of national concern' (which was a prerequisite for most
        of the Länder's measures) expired in November 2021 and was not extended. Instead, the Bundestag passed another
        amendment of the Infection Protection Act which gave the Länder the power for certain measures regardless
        whether there was an 'epidemic emergency', but only until the beforementioned 20 March 2022. After that date,
        only basic measures (such as mandatory masks in certain facilities) remained feasible. So it is fair to say that
        the main political impetus for ending the pandemic measures came from the federal level.</td>
      <td>Central government, via statutory decrees, transposed into Acts of Parliament" (see report sections 16 and
        63).</td>
      <td>The federal government declared, on 9 May 2023, that the emergency due to COVID-19 had ended. As a number of
        states imposed more stringent restrictions than the federal government, the former were lifted sooner than the
        latter. Both at the federal and state-levels, restrictions were lifted through executive acts, ie decrees and
        ministerial orders.</td>
      <td>The federal government. The NCOC recommended bringing all pandemic measures to an end across the country in
        March 2022. As indicated in the report, the NCOC had tailored its recommended measures in accordance with the
        positivity ratio in any given area. As a result, the measures were brought to an end gradually. By the end of
        March 2022 the NCOC was disbanded, and thereafter at least one provincial government (Sindh) reintroduced some
        restrictions (to counter a sudden rise in infections). But these were quickly lifted.</td>
      <td>As of 20 June 2023, the pandemic measures have not been completely abandoned in Russia. The state of high
        alert is still in effect in more than half of the federated units, including Moscow and the Republic of
        Buryatia. On 7 June 2023, the press reported[1] that the regional Commission on the Prevention and Elimination
        of Emergencies and Ensuring Fire Safety has decided to request the Government of Buryatia to end the state of
        high alert which had been enacted in the Republic on 7 February 2020. However, no legal action has yet been
        taken. In Moscow, the Mayor’s Decree on the state of high alert has been amended to repeal most of the health
        restrictions (including requirements to maintain social distance, wear masks and take PCR tests before attending
        public events). However, the restriction on public gatherings (except for those specifically authorized by
        Moscow Government) is still in place, and its violation, even in the form of solitary picketing, may result in
        administrative liability. On the federal level, the coronavirus public health measures introduced by the Chief
        Public Health Officer were lifted by the Regulation of the Chief Health Officer of 15 May 2023 No 4. This
        Regulation repealed 11 prior acts or provisions, including those suggesting the maximum occupancy for public
        venues, the ‘quarantine’ rule and the recommendations on wide Covid-19 testing.</td>
      <td>As set out in part IV. A of the final (2023) version of our report, the final lockdown measures came to an end
        with the lifting of the national state of disaster by the national (federal) government on 5 April 2022.</td>

      <td>The UK Government brought most measures to an end (or let lapse) for England; the SNGs brought them to an end
        for devolved areas. England led first on most if not all measures.</td>
      <td>1.a. Which level of government brought pandemic measures to an end? \nThis was not a centralized process, nor
        was it uniform within any given level of government. Individual measures—restrictions, mandates, and
        supports—were implemented and terminated or allowed to expire on individual timelines. \n1.b. Which level of
        government was the first to lift restrictions? \nSpecific state governments were first to end certain pandemic
        measures (restrictions, mandates, and supports) but there were not many restrictions (per se) in place at the
        federal level. \n1.c. How exactly did it end/was it de-regulated? \nThrough a decentralized, non-uniform
        process. Even within the federal government, different measures were implemented and terminated on distinct
        timelines. For example, measures adopted under the National Emergencies Act were ended by Congress (with
        presidential approval via a decision not to veto the measure) in April 2023. Measures adopted under Section 319
        of the Public Health Service Act were mostly terminated by the HHS Secretary (acting with approval of the
        President) on May 11, 2023. Measures adopted under other sections of the Public Health Service Act (via PREP Act
        and EAU declarations) remain in effect without an announced termination/expiration date. Moreover, some measures
        were adopted and terminated independently of any emergency declaration. Similarly, state and local governments
        have typically terminated their pandemic response measures on a case-by-case basis, rather than lifting every
        measure simultaneously.</td>
      <td>The Federal Government brought pandemic measures to an end, pursuant to its authority over health matters
        under the Constitution. The state of emergency ended on August 2021 and was not renewed. Restrictions were
        enforced through the Movement Control Order and the government formulated a “National Recovery Plan” for the
        country to progressively move out of the restrictions and regulations under the MCO.</td>
      <td>The Federal Government (FG) played a significant role in bringing an end to pandemic measures. The
        deregulation occurred through the non-renewal of the decrees that had established the measures. For instance,
        the state of alarm established in Decree No. 4,160 was continuously renewed by subsequent decrees until April
        2021. Similarly, measures such as rental payment deferrals and eviction suspensions, introduced in Decree Nº
        4,169 in 2020, were extended by new decrees until October 2021. In cases where measures were not decree-based,
        such as economic support in the form of cash transfers, the FG simply discontinued these transfers on the
        grounds of the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing other types of transfers for different types of assistance.
        The last two examples are included in Parts V-VI of the report.</td>

        effective response?</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>a. See n 8 of my text, the recommendations of the Court of Auditors in the footnote have been added for the
        update: \nIn contrast to this, the states play a strong role in the enforcement of federal legislation. The
        Federation only operates a small number of federal administrative authorities throughout the country (direct
        federal administration; eg in fiscal administration). In most subject matters, the executive powers of the
        Federation are exercised by the Governor and the state authorities subordinate to their office (indirect federal
        administration; mittelbare Bundesverwaltung).[1]Legally speaking, the Governor and the state authorities are
        bound by instructions of the competent members of the Federal Government when implementing federal legislation.
        From a political perspective, the Federal Government is dependent on cooperation from the Governor, the state
        government, and the state administration. ‘Public health’ is among the subject matters in which indirect federal
        administration applies. This means that the ‘chain of instruction’ runs from the Minister of Health via the
        Governor—or another member of the state government acting in their place—to the district administrative
        authorities acting as health authorities. Individual decisions on the ‘frontline’ are thereby taken by state
        authorities, which enjoy some margin of appreciation in the implementation of federal instructions. This became
        quite obvious during the pandemic in three situations:[2] First, health authorities in different states had
        diverging approaches as whom to oblige to self-isolate after contact with an infected person (see further Part
        IV.A.7 below). Second, some Governors had to be put under considerable political pressure by the Federal
        Government before accepting and implementing unpopular measures at the state level. Third, despite a federal
        vaccination plan, there have been some differences in the distribution of vaccines and number administered in
        the different states in 2021 (see Part IV.A.8 below). \n[1] Federal Constitutional Law (1920), arts 102–103.
        \n[2] For a general critical appraisal of the role of federalism in the health care system during the pandemic,
        see MM Hofmarcher and C Singhuber, ‘Federalism in the Health service: Weaknesses of Covid-19 Crisis management’
        (Föderalismus im Gesundheitswesen: Schwächen des Covid-19 Krisenmanagements) HS&amp;I Policy Brief (June 2021).
        The Court of Auditors also criticized insufficient cooperation between the Federation and the States during the
        pandemic in its Recommendations from the Covid-19-pandemic (April 2023), pp 18 seq. \n \nb. See also n 52 of the
        report, below in the UPDATED VERSION which you are about to receive \n[.......] As a result, from mid-March 2020
        onwards and especially during the lockdowns of winter 2020/2021 and November/December 2021, a new pattern
        (‘second phase’) emerged: the Federal Minister issued nationwide ordinances, while additional statewide or
        regional measures were regularly decreed by the Governors or the district authorities (see Part II.C above,
        citing examples from the states of Tyrol and Vienna).[7] One important example for this approach came up in
        December 2021 when the (Vice-)Governor of Upper Austria, due to still relatively higher case numbers, prolonged
        the general ‘stay-at-home order’ and the closure of shops and services until 16 December even though the
        nationwide order had ended on 11 December.[8] \nThere were two major exceptions to this approach: In February
        2021, the Federal Minister for Health called for mandatory exit tests for all districts in Northern Tyrol due to
        the outbreak of the Beta variant while the Governor was reluctant to decree them. As a result, the Federal
        Minister of Health issued the relevant ordinance himself,[9] based on section 43a of the Infectious Diseases Act
        which granted him the power to issue regionally differentiated public health ordinances. The same happened in
        April 2021 when the Minister decreed a full lockdown only for the three eastern states,[10] while the rest of
        the country remained in partial lockdown. The general nation-wide lockdown in November 2021 was also attributed
        by some commentators to the hesitancy of state Governors to take stricter measures at state level which resulted
        in the need for nation-wide action. \nA new pattern emerged in late June 2021 (and continued into 2023) when the
        Governor (Mayor) of Vienna (not the Federal Minister) decreed stricter measures for this state while they were
        softened at federal level (see Part II.C above).[11] \n \n \n[7] For an overview (dated November 2020), see P

      <td>In the case of Brazil, it certainly helped as the president was fiercely against any public health measures
        and tried to stop them at the subnational levels yet lost in the Supreme Court. That allowed all local governors
        and mayors to adopt such measures and most did. Yet is was also problematic, given that some states and many
        municipalities in Brazil are not resourceful enough to respond to a pandemic effectively and the lack of support
        from the federal government was critical, as the dramatic case of lack of oxygen in hospitals in Amazonas’ state
        illustrated. Delays in vaccination is another example. Only resourceful states like Sao Paulo managed to carry
        out their own vaccination programme whereas many others relied exclusively on the federal government.</td>

      <td>To answer this question depends on a very strange notion of what the EU is. \nThe EU is not a state. As we say
        in paragraph 1 of our report: “Often described (unhelpfully) as ‘sui generis’, [the EU] may be conceptualised as
        a particularly dense form of intergovernmental organisation, or a ‘supra-national’ or ‘quasi-federal’
        organisation. While few think of the EU as a ‘State-in-waiting’, equally, few go to the other extreme of
        thinking of the EU as only a vehicle through which the governments of its Member States pursue their interests.
        The EU is neither an emerging ‘United States of Europe’ nor merely a regional World Trade Organization (WTO). It
        is probably best to conceptualise the EU as a multi-level system of governance, within which heterarchical
        relationships structure relations between Member State and EU-level institutions.” \nSo, determining whether
        ‘the existence of Member States’ made for a problematic or fractured health policy, or an effective response, is
        a very odd thing to ask. The EU does not exist – constitutionally speaking – independently of its Member States.
        It is created in international law by the will of those Member States. \n If you are asking something like,
        would the Member States have been better off in their Covid-19 response without the EU, again the answer
        depends. A large and well-resourced Member State, like Germany, might have been. A less well developed Member
        State, with consequent less public health / communicable disease capacity, and less access to post-pandemic
        restructuring funds, like Bulgaria, not so much. Taking all the Member States together, would they have been
        better off if the EU had done nothing in the Covid-19 space – no. Collaboration and pooling of resources, to
        create a larger entity, sharing of data to inform regulation, and so on is better than not to do those things.

      <td>In my opinion, health policy was not problematically fractured in Germany. It was definitely not the case that
        the Länder's governments were ineffective or slow in their responses to the pandemic. And because of the
        (legally not binding) agreements between the Federal Chancellor(s) and the Länder's governments, also a high
        degree of uniformity was reached (some would even say: too high, because the basic sense of federalism is to
        allow regional divergences). When this uniformity was at risk around Easter 2021, the federal government reacted
        with the 'Federal Emergency Brake' (which played not such a big role for daily life because infection numbers
        already decreased at that time, but it was still an important political signal).</td>
      <td>It seems complicated to answer this question. There is no agreement in the literature or overall empirical
        research. Based on some inquiries after the first pandemic phase, my hunch is that subnational governments led
        to a problematic/fractured health policy. That is especially true regarding managing healthcare services (for
        infected people) and public health response. I have attached a note for you (it was a handout for an
        international conference that I did not develop into a paper), which you may find helpful in understanding my
        point.</td>
      <td>Health policy was fractured briefly at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, when the federal government
        hesitated (so to say) to impose health restrictions. A number of state-level governments went ahead with those
        restrictions. Furthermore, even after the federal government imposed the "traffic light system" of restrictions,
        a few states - all ruled by different parties than that of the federal government - decided to go ahead with
        more stringent measures. This arguably did not undermine the overall health response, but rather enhanced it.
      </td>
      <td>This is a difficult question to answer: I would say that the mere existence of subnational governments would
        likely have led to a fractured health policy, but this was avoided only because of their coordination with the
        federal government under the NCOC. This coordination enabled more accurate tweaking of the intensity of measures
        and targeting of the right areas/cities. When the subnational governments were developing their own responses
        (during the initial stages of the pandemic) there was confusion and public resentment: the response of the Sindh
        government was viewed as too extreme and the Punjab's response was viewed as somewhat lax. Left unchecked, this
        would have probably led to a fractured health policy. But the coordination between national and subnational
        governments lent greater legitimacy and effectiveness to the response. Ultimately the subnational governments
        played a crucial role in enforcement as well as data collection. Had there been no subnational governments it
        would likely have been impossible to identify Covid-19 'hotspots' and to strike a sustainable balance – it is
        after all a country with nearly 230 million people. And conversely, had subnational governments not been
        prompted to coordinate with the federal government, there would likely have been a lot of disparity in the
        response as witnessed during the initial stages of the pandemic.</td>
      <td>In Russia, the decentralized model of response to the pandemic, when restrictive measures were enacted and
        repealed by subnational governments, has been characterized by officials as an effective and flexible reaction
        to the risks created by the spread of the virus. It has been argued that the constituent units have managed to
        maintain the balance between the level of threat and the need to preserve economic activity, which varied
        greatly from one region to another. However, the overall high number of coronavirus deaths, the lack of regional
        funds to provide adequate social assistance and the remarkable inequality in terms of healthcare services across
        the regions do not allow to characterize the Russian response to the pandemic as effective.</td>
      <td>While South Africa is a quasi-federal state, the disaster response was driven and coordinated throughout by
        national (federal) government, with provincial and local governments functioning only as implementing agents.
        There was accordingly not a fractured response. It could be argued that subverting provincial and local
        governments to national executive authority through the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, as the
        pandemic response played out, somewhat betrayed the quasi-federal constitutional ethos. But, apart from being
        authorised by the DMA itself, the counterargument is that this was required for an effective response and that
        it in fact enhanced the effectiveness of the national response.</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>It appears that there were no obvious adverse medical consequences for allowing SNGs to lead their own health
        responses. Each of the SNG governments were often more open to more robust public health responses. This
        political fact, and a tendency towards a large area of common agreement on health advice between experts at
        national and sub-national levels, as well as similar epidemic curves at similar times, seems to account
        significantly for why policies tended to move together despite notable diverges on some issues (e.g. masks).
      </td>
      <td>This is debatable. It certainly led to fractured policy responses. But the federal administration’s lack of
        authority probably resulted in protective measures being implemented in some places at times when they otherwise
        would not have been. At one point, for example, President Trump announced that he would force states to lift
        restrictions on businesses but he lacked authority to do so. For one who feels those restrictions were
        effective, the lack of authority supported an effective response in this instance.</td>
      <td>As I mentioned, due to the powers of the federal government in health matters, conflicts in policies between
        federal and state governments were minimal. It was very much a centralized, top-down affair but one that is
        facilitated by the relationship between federal and state health officials (ie, the civil service). Some state
        governments (particularly Selangor) raised concerns about the federal government’s lack of consultation with
        state governments in formulating and enforcing policies to combat the spread of Covid-19. But in practice, the
        civil service at both levels found ways to work around the political conflicts and obstacles. Where fractured or
        conflicting policies did exist, they did not implicate “health policy” per se. Rather they concerned issues such
        as management of religious activities (a state-level matter), control over public spaces in the states, rules of
        immigration (Sabah and Sarawak are given complete autonomy over immigration in their respective states).</td>
      <td>Due to the centralization of measures by the FG, subnational entities were not involved in designing COVID-19
        policies but rather were obligated to implement and adhere to these measures. Consequently, subnational entities
        issued their own ordinances (or municipal decrees) that aligned with the public health measures established by
        the FG. See, for example, Ordinance Nro. 001-2021 from the Chacao Municipality in Venezuela.</td>
